### WARNING 
Some ISPs don't allow torrent downloads, even legitimate ones. A VPN can help, but may violate your ISPs terms of service.  

***We accept NO RESPONSIBILITY for any action your ISP may take against you for violating ToS.***
 
Also, torrenting without a VPN exposes your IP address, which is dangerous.
You can use VPN while torrenting to hide your actual IP address.
Make sure to use a VPN which supports P2P (Peer-to-Peer)

6. Once the download is done your folder should look something like this (below). If it didn't, you didnt read the step above correctly, and it might look different. If you have a **HMW-mod_1.5.0** folder its content should contain `hmw-mod`, `hmw-usermaps`, and a few other files, copy all of those up a folder.

7. After you are done downloading, start the launcher and click verify, if you did everything correctly you should have mod 1.5.0 installed succesfully, and the verification should pass.

8. **Important:** After download reached 100%, your torrent client will switch from "Downloading" to "Seeding" (sharing the files with other users). Please leave your torrent client running and seeding if you can. This allows others to get the mod files faster and helps take the load off of our servers. If you're worried about using too much bandwidth, look up how to limit your torrent client's upload speed.
